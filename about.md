# About

Varie was built to jump start your development with a bit of elegance.

* A simple routing Engine built on top of Vue Router
* Routing Middleware
* State management - Vuex with a bit of magic
* A dependency injection container
* Web pack configuration made easy (Mix)
* HTTP Middleware
* Plugins
* And more!

While it may see there are a ton of extras, you are able to rip these out easily with service providers. And since Varie is a dev dependency by not including service providers it will lower your total app size.
