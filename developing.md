## Developing

Varie uses a elegant wrapper (<a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix">Laravel Mix</a>) around webpack to make bundling quick and appealing.

To start developing you just need to run `npm run watch`. Running this command launches a browser and uses browser sync to help make your development expeierence better. You should also review the other commands within `package.json` on how to run production builds.
