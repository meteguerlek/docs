Varie was built to jump start your VueJS development with a bit of elegance. Some of the features are :

- A simple routing Engine built on top of Vue Router
- App and Route Middleware
- State management using Vuex with a bit of magic
- Dependency injection container using InversifyJS
- Form Validation

While it may see there are a ton of extras, you are able to rip these out easily with service providers.
